    detail: `The NDA parade ground is a sprawling expanse of tarmac in front of the Manoj Pandey Block. The majestic background to the parade ground is provided by the QM Fort. The Quarter-Deck towers in the foreground, keeping constant vigil on cadets undergoing the rigours of foot, cane and ceremonial drill. The drill square measures 450 x 150 m. The inter-services character is evident throughout the length and breadth of the parade ground. It is reflected in the immaculately positioned guns at the entrance and four corners of the tarmac, the two T-55 tanks, the towering Quarter Deck mast (99' 6 3/4" high) and the two aircrafts, representing the three Services.

    Drill is the bedrock of discipline. The Adjutant on his white charger is a symbol of authority and discipline. The grand inale of the Passing Out Parade is enacted each term with clockwork precision amidst ceremony and fanfare on this hallowed ground. The soulful and solemn strains of 'Auld Lang Syne' orchestrate the slow march at the Passing Out Parade. The parade ground was named 'Khetarpal Parade Ground' in everlasting memory of 2/Lt Arun Khetarpal (38 Course/â€˜F' Squadron) who was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra for displaying unparalleled gallantry in the Battle of Basantar in 1971.`,

The structure is an adaptation of the Lion Capitol of Ashoka at Sarnath. The Ashoka Pillar junction becomes a beehive of activity at the sound of the siren. Cadets ebb and flow in assorted rigs across the junction in all directions in a mad race against time. The Ashoka Pillar befittingly stands at the cross-roads of Trishul Marg and the President's Drive as a symbol for steadfastness in the choice of the 'Harder Right rather than the Easier Wrong'.`,
